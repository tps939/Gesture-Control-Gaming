# Gesture-Control-Gaming

Gesture recognition is an alternative user interface for providing real-time data to a computer. Instead of typing with keys or tapping on a touch screen, camera is used as a
motion sensor to perceive and interpret movements as the primary source of data input. The recognized gesture henceforth is used as data input for games.
